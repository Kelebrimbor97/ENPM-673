# Project-1---Augmented-Reality

This is my submission for the first project for the Subject ENPM 673 for the SPring 2022 semester.

Part 1a,1b and 2a:

The code for parts 1a, 1b, and 2a is titled 'prj1_q1a.py'. For Running this code, it is advised (not necessary) to use an IDE such as visual studio.

1. In your working directory (preferably the one where the code is located), ensure that you have the video file - '1tagvideo.mp4' and the image file - 'testudo.png'
2. Run the code and get the results
3. By default, sections of the code have been commented to prevent the writing of the video to storage of the host computer. Lines 39, 90, and 104 may be uncommented if user wants to write the video to storage.
4. Lines 66 to 79 may be uncommented if user wants to visualise ordered corners.

The code for part 2b is titled 'cube.py' and runs in the exact same way, without the need for the 'testudo.png' image.
